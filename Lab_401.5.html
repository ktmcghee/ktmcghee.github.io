    <title>Leaf Peepers Abundant! Fall Hike in the Aspens</title>

   <h1>Leaf Peeping Before it's too Late</h1>
    
      <p>My friend and I almost always work on the weekends. We realized we have missed the fall foilage in recent years and really needed to get out in nature. 
        We both had last Sunday off and decided to take advantage of the pleasant weather to do a fall hike. 
        I had never heard the term leaf peeper until this fall. It's an informal term for people that travel to view and photograph the changing colors of fall foilage. 
        I am neutral on the term but some residents of these areas use the term with annoyance and disdain due to the increased traffic and congestion.</p>
    
    <h2>Abyss Lake Hike in Grant, CO </h2>
      <p>I drive a Honda Fit, a very low clearance car, so off road trails are a no go. 
        We wanted to do a hike in areas with aspen groves, 8 to 12 miles in length, within 90 minutes of Denver, and a good amount of elevation change. Normally I avoid crowds, but I knew this was the last weekend to see fall foilage.
        We decided to do the Abyss trail to Helms Lake (12 miles length) outside of Grant, CO. We left Denver around 9:45 and arrived to the park around 11:30. There was a lot of people with stop and go traffic about a mile from the trailhead. 
        Everyone was polite and most people stayed about 20 feet from their car, clearly not intending to hike. I parked along the road about a quarter mile from the traihead. About 2 miles into the trail, the crowds cleared up
        and we only saw a handful of people. The trail was well maintained and the aspens were at their peak gold color. Clouds started rolling in and the aspens were thinning, so we decided to turn around 5 miles in. 
        A forest ranger was directing traffic from the park road to the main road, so the exit was easy. The traffic back to Denver was suprisingly light.   /p>
