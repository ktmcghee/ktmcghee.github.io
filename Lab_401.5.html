   <h1>Fall Hike on the Abyss Lake Trail in Grant, CO</h1>
    
      <p>My friend and I almost always work on the weekends. We have both been busy and realized we have not gone for a hike in a while. We decided to take advantage of the nice weather and the fact that we both had Sunday off to do a fall hike. 
        I had never heard the term leaf peeper until this fall. It's an informal term for people that travel to view and photograph the changing colors of fall foilage. 
        I am neutral on the term, but some residents of these areas use the term with annoyance and disdain, due to the increased traffic and congestion.</p>
