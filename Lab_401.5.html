    <title>Leaf Peepers Abundant! Fall Hike in the Aspens</title>

   <h1>Leaf Peeping Before it's too Late</h1>
    
      <p>My friend and I almost always work on the weekends. We have both been very busy and realized we have missed enjoying the fall foilage in recent years. 
        We both had last Sunday off and decided to take advantage of the pleasant weather to do a fall hike. 
        I had never heard the term leaf peeper until this fall. It's an informal term for people that travel to view and photograph the changing colors of fall foilage. 
        I am neutral on the term, but some residents of these areas use the term with annoyance and disdain due to the increased traffic and congestion.</p>
    
    <h2>Abyss Lake Hike in the Aspens </h2>
      <p>I drive a Honda Fit, a very low clearance car, so off road trails are a no go for my car. 
        We wanted to do a hike with aspen groves, within 90 minutes of Denver, and had some elevation change. Normally I like avoiding crowds, but I knew this was the last weekend to see fall foilage.
        We decided to do the Abyss trail outside of Grant, CO. We left Denver around 9:45 and arrived to the park around 11. There was a lot of people with stop and go traffic about a mile from the trailhead. 
        Everyone was polite and most people stayed about 20 feet from their car. I parked along the road about a quarter mile from the traihead. We could already tell that the leaves were in peak color.   /p>
