    <h2>Table for Potential Fall Hikes</h2>
      <p>I drive a Honda Fit, a very low clearance car, so off road trails are a no go. 
        We wanted to do a hike in areas with aspen groves, 8 to 12 miles in length, within 90 minutes of Denver, and a good amount of elevation change. Normally I avoid crowds, but I knew this was the last weekend to see fall foilage.
        We decided to do the Abyss trail (12 miles length) outside of Grant, CO. We left Denver around 9:45 and arrived to the park around 11. There was a lot of people with stop and go traffic about a mile from the trailhead. 
        Everyone was polite and most people stayed about 20 feet from their car, clearly not intending to hike. I parked along the road about a quarter mile from the traihead. About 2 miles into the trail, the crowds cleared up
        and we only saw a handful of people. The trail was well maintained and the aspens seemsd to be at their peak. We turned around about 4 miles up the trail. We dediced to turn around due to the increase
        in clouds and the lack of aspens at higher elevations. A forest ranger was directing traffic from the park road to the main road, making it an easy exit. The traffic back to Denver was suprisingly light.   /p>
