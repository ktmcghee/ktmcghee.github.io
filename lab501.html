    <p>This is definitely a worthwile hike to do in the autumn, even with crowds and traffic. The hike starts of pretty easy, with a jawdropping view of the aspens 2.5 miles in. 
      Miles 4 and 5 are steeper with switchbacks. There is a great view of Bierstadt and other peaks. It is close to Denver and easily accessible. </p>
